<h3 align="center">Trading with the Rhythm of the Market</h3>

**Clione is a sophisticated VWAP-Enhanced TWAP algorithm that combines elegant execution with adaptive market flow.** Inspired by the sea angel's wisdom of moving with ocean currents rather than fighting them, Clione executes large orders with measured rhythm (TWAP) while adapting to the market's natural flow (VWAP). Built specifically for the Hyperliquid ecosystem, it provides institutional-grade trading algorithms accessible to all traders.

We bridge the gap between complex algorithmic trading and user-friendly execution, offering dynamic order sizing, real-time slippage protection, and comprehensive market analysis ‚Äì all powered by mathematical precision and executed on Hyperliquid's cutting-edge infrastructure.
